# portfolio

This is my coding portfolio where I will upload my work so there is an easy way to click to my projects. By having an easy website with a user friendly interface, all of my projects for future employers are clearly laid out for them to look at. This will save both time and effort looking through various links and sites, instead providing the necessary links for them to do directly to my projects.

# Usage

I will be using this as my portfolio, editing it as I create more projects. Along with this, I can submit it as tangible proof of my ability to code to potential employers in the future.
